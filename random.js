/*const weatherInfoDiv = document.getElementById("weatherInfo");:
This line retrieves the HTML element with the ID "weatherInfo" using document.getElementById(). It assigns this element to the variable weatherInfoDiv, which represents the <div> element where we want to display the weather information.

weatherInfoDiv.innerHTML = ...;:
The innerHTML property of an HTML element represents the markup of the element's contents. In this line, we're setting the innerHTML of weatherInfoDiv to a template string (delimited by backticks ``) that contains the HTML content we want to display.

Template String (${}) Interpolation:
Inside the template string, ${} is used for interpolation, allowing us to insert dynamic values (e.g., weatherData.name, weatherData.main.temp, weatherData.weather[0].description) into the HTML content.

HTML Content:

<h2>Weather Information</h2>: This line creates an <h2> heading with the text "Weather Information" to indicate the section's purpose.
<p>City: ${weatherData.name}</p>: This line creates a paragraph (<p>) element displaying the city name retrieved from weatherData.name.
<p>Temperature: ${weatherData.main.temp} Â°C</p>: This line displays the temperature (in Celsius) retrieved from weatherData.main.temp.
<p>Description: ${weatherData.weather[0].description}</p>: This line displays the weather description (e.g., "clear sky," "rain," etc.) retrieved from weatherData.weather[0].description.
So, when the displayWeatherInfo function is called with weatherData as its argument, it updates the weatherInfoDiv element's innerHTML to include the weather information dynamically retrieved from the weatherData object. This results in the weather information being displayed in the HTML page within the designated <div> element.</div>*/
